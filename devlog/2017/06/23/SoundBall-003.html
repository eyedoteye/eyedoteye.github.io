    <p>This week I’ve finished up the second iteration of this mindful
sound-piano-thing experiment. And now, for a post-mortem!</p>

<hr />

<p><img src="/assets/SoundBall003A.gif" alt="SoundBall Second Iteration" /></p>

<p>First, the technicals:<br />
I’m not sure javascript was the right fit for me for prototyping.
It’s quick to develop, and quick to share, but only for the most straightforward
of ideas. There are also some latency issues, even though I’m not doing
anything particularly intensive. And that’s no good!
As I’m not actually concerned with the quick-sharing aspect, I’m planning on
making a switch over to unity.
I think both approaches have a bit of a learning curve before an acceptable
prototyping speed can be achieved, but unity promises far more, in terms of
testing more complex ideas.</p>

<p>Now, the design:<br />
Although there is <em>some</em> substance in the current iteration, as a whole, the design is
currently unsuccesful.</p>

<p>I like the exploration into heavyness, but the slipping part is unnessential to
this plaything’s purpose. Originally it was there as an ‘encouragement’ for the
player to drop the ball and see the frequencies collapse into a note, however in
practice, this slipping is frustrating, and since the center of the ball
determines the current playing frequency, it only serves to weaken the mindful
connection between sound and player.</p>

<p>The ‘encouragement’ has also been replaced by the starting state of the ball.
I imagine that the start screen for this game will have the ball hovering, and
on start the ball will fall and collapse down the first note. This will clearly
demonstrate what the main functionality of this plaything is.</p>

<p>Also, the intuition of the exponentially increasing frequency of each ascending
note is largely lost. The game is currently too much of a move this ball above
the line and drop kind of deal. It lacks an emphasis in the exploration needed
to imbue a mindful play.</p>

<p>Graphically, putting aside roughness due to being a prototype,
the gradients need to be expanded into something more visually meaningful.
Currrently, the compressed compression that they hold is visually lost. (Also, they are
somewhat incorrect, but that’s not as important as it can be patched up later.)</p>

<p>It is also non obvious that the piano keys are pressable. It is most certainly
worth the effort to improve this. Changing the keys to be more piano-like could
solve this problem, as well as improve the connection between frequency and note
for the player.</p>

<hr />
<p>I think I will spend more time exploring heavyness as a separate project. It’s
pretty interesting!
But also, I will now spend time re-designing a bunch of things and
re-approaching this in Unity! It should serve as a good project for learning the
ropes.</p>
